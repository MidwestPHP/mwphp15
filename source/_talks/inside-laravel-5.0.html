    5.0. We'll explore putting your Controllers on a crash diet with Custom Request Objects and Method Level Dependency
    Injection, increasing contexuality with Route & Event Annotations, managing 3rd party authentication with Socialite,
    understanding the new Directory Structure and Service Provider Architecture, leveraging FlySystem Integration,
    improving performance with Route Caching and increasing decoupling using Contracts. Special attention will be given
