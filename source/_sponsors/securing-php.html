<p>The only constant in the world of web application development is change. With this change comes a whole host of new security concerns and problems. The PHP ecosystem is no different.</p>

<p>Securing PHP wants to help take the guesswork out of protecting your PHP applications and put you on the right path towards a more secure future. It will give you the terms, the technology and the best practices to help keep your apps (and users) protected. Security doesn't have to be hard, but it can be overwhelming.</p>
