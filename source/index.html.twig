<h1>Midwest PHP has come and gone</h1>
<p>Thank you to everyone who attended this year's Midwest PHP 2015 Conference. We had a blast putting it on for all of
    you and we hope you had a blast attending. We are working hard on the 2016 venue and information so stay tuned for
    that. In the mean time, don't forget to fill out the survey we sent, provide <a
            href="https://joind.in/event/view/2871" target="_blank">feedback</a> on the talks you attended, and <a
            href="/write-ups">read</a> some thoughts on this year's conference.</p>

<p>See you again soon in 2016.</p>
