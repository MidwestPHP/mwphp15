<p>Since 2000, Detroit-based Nexcess has been making PHP applications perform to their maximum potential with their unique lineup of optimized managed hosting products.  Along the way, they've collected accolades from the Inc. 5000, Deloitte Fast 500, Dell Founders Club 50, while growing to offer services from Australia to the United Kingdom.   Nexcess was chosen as the original web hosting partner for Varien Bento (now Magento), and is endorsed exclusively as the recommended hosting partner of ExpressionEngine. </p> 

<p>As developers themselves, the Nexcess team has launched several PHP applications over the years, which includes their data center management platform (NOCWorx), a server management interface (InterWorx), and a leading Magento plugin that integrates Varnish caching with e-commerce storefronts (Turpentine). </p>

<p>This year, Nexcess will be sending hosting experts to recruit and chat about optimized server platforms - from caching options to scalability to security.  Be sure to say hello, or visit <a href="https://www.nexcess.net" target="_blank">https://www.nexcess.net</a> to learn more.  </p>
