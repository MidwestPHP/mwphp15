<p>You can git pull, merge, and even force-push with the best of them, but what’s really going on in that .git folder?
    What’s a commit, and how does it know where it came from? What does checking out a tag have to do with detaching
    your head, and why does rebase mess things up so thoroughly? In this talk, we’ll get inside individual commits and
    learn to push them around, then zoom out to the whole repository. Come find out how Git’s glorified game of
    Connect-the-Dots can improve the development workflow and collaboration opportunities for your whole team!</p>
