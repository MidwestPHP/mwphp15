speakerlastname: Vandervelde

<p>Keep your mobile-developer friends your friends. Mobile development suffers a lot of unique problems. A poorly
    designed back-end API shouldn't be one of them. How can you make their lives easier? Plan ahead. </p>
<p>HTTP is simple and ubiquitous, but it isn't always easy. In his talk for Android developers, Jesse Wilson
    describes HTTP as a "hostile world" saying "The network is unreliable. 3G networking is slow. Using WiFi
    drains your battery. The NSA is spying on you."</p>
<p>Come to this talk to get to know the problems that mobile projects have. In this session we&#39;ll talk
	about all the different ways that you can make your API more friendly to mobile application development
	including caching, security, and resource management.</p>
