title: Midwest PHP Uncon

---

Midwest PHP will be hosting its first ever uncon at the Midwest PHP 2015 conference. What is an uncon you ask?  An uncon is much like your regular conference, but includes unplanned talks.  For instance if you submitted a session idea to our call for papers or in the event you forgot to submit your ideas this is your chance to present on those talks to the attendees of Midwest PHP. 

We will be setting up a blank white board each morning for you to fill in with the talk you wish to give. Be ready to grab your slot as they will fill up quickly.

For more information send a tweet to [@midwestphp](http://twitter.com/midwestphp) and we would be happy to speak with you about it.
