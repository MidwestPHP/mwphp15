<p>Let me ask you a question... What’s in *your* project root? If you take a look at PHP projects hosted on GitHub,
    you’ll find a plethora of configuration and other files in the project's root directory that are made out of
    everything. There’s JSON, Markdown, YAML, XML, and even some PHP (phew). Let’s talk about what all of these files do
    and what things you might be missing out on. From Composer to PHPUnit and from Travis to Phing, there are plenty of
    tools you can configure to improve the quality of your project, some with very little effort.</p>
