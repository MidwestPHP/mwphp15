<p>Do you have to spend hours wrapping your head around your entire application before you can make simple changes to
    one part? Is each layer too reliant on other layers so each change is a major revision? You need container coding.
    Learn to segregate each layer of your code so you can deal with each individually. Your code will be flexible, easy
    to maintain, and ready for new features.</p>
